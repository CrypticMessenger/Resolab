# Spaudio Steering Document

> **Mission:** Build "Spaudio," the first Vibe-Coded, Agentic Spatial Audio Editor.
> **Vibe:** Cyberpunk, Professional, "System 2" Intelligence, Transparent Reasoning.

## 🧠 Core Directives for the AI Agent

1.  **Expose the Brain:** Never hide the reasoning. If Spaudio makes a decision (e.g., "Moving drums to the back"), it must explain *why* (`> Detected 'background' intent, applying Z+10 translation`).
2.  **Multimodal First:** Inputs are Voice, Video, and Gestures. Text is secondary.
3.  **No "Wrappers":** We are not wrapping an API. We are orchestrating a system. The Python backend ("The Brain") controls the Frontend ("The Body").
4.  **Eclipsa Native:** We output next-gen IAMF, not just MP3s. We are future-proof.

## 🎨 Aesthetic & UX Guidelines

*   **Visual Style:** Dark mode, neon accents (Teal/Purple), monospace fonts for data streams (representing the AI's thought process).
*   **Interaction:** "Minority Report" style. Fluid, real-time, responsive.
*   **Tone:** The AI is a "Director," not a servant. It suggests, collaborates, and creates.

## 🏗 Architectural Constraints

*   **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router), Three.js (R3F).
*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI). This is where the *Agent* lives.
*   **State Sync:** WebSocket connection between Brain (Python) and Body (JS). Low latency is paramount.

## 📝 Vibe Coding Log

*   **Session 1:** Strategy Alignment. Pivot to "Archetype C" (Dream Machine). Added Python backend for "System 2" capabilities.
*   **Session 2:** [Pending] Initialization of dual-stack architecture.
