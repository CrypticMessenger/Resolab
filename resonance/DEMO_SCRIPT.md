## 🌑 0:00 - 0:15: The Problem (Cinematic Intro)
**Visual:** All Black Screen. 
**Text Fade In:** "For 100 years..."
**Text Change:** "...audio has been trapped..."
**Text Change:** "...in stereo."
*(Fade to a flat 2D waveform line boredly scrolling across the screen)*

**Voiceover:** "We live in a 3D world. We build 3D games. We explore 3D webs. Yet, our audio tools are still stuck in two dimensions."

---

## 💥 0:15 - 0:25: The Reveal
**Visual:** The 2D Waveform *shatters* outwards into the 3D Resonance Grid.
**Text:** **RESONANCE**
**Sub-text:** "The Era of Spatial Authoring."

**Voiceover:** "Introducing Resonance. The first spatial audio director powered by Gemini 3."

*(Beat Drop - High Energy Music Starts)*

## 🔮 0:25 - 0:55: The "Magic" (Auto-Foley / Multimodal)
**Visual:** Full screen video clip (Rainy Tokyo Street). Sound is OFF.
**Voiceover:** "Imagine taking a video..."
**Action:** The video frame shrinks and drops onto the Resonance Grid.
**Voiceover:** "...and giving it depth."

**Visual:** The "Thinking" UI explodes with tags: `RAIN`, `NEON`, `TRAFFIC`.
**Sound:** *WHOOSH* - The 3D audio kicks in instant, rich, immersive.

**Voiceover:** "Multimodal agents analyze every pixel. They see the rain. They calculate the traffic. And they place sound sources in physical space."

**Visual:** **"LISTEN."** (Text Overlay)
*(Music cuts out. Pure 5s Spatial Sound demo. Rain surrounds the user.)*

## 🧠 0:55 - 1:35: The "Brain" (Reasoning Execution)
**Visual:** Split screen. Chat Prompt on Left. 3D Grid on Right.
**Voiceover:** "It's not just generation. It's reasoning."

**Action:** Typing: *"A ghost walking on the ceiling."*
**Visual:** Zoom into the Code Logs. Highlight: `Elevation: +3m`.
**Voiceover:** "Resonance understands physics. It knows that 'ceiling' means positive elevation. It knows 'walking' means trajectory. It builds a Semantic Scene Graph."

**Visual:** A glowing orb helps the "Ghost" sound pass *over* the camera.
*(5s Audio Demo: Footsteps panning front-to-back overhead)*

**Voiceover:** "True verticality. No manual mixing required."

## 🚀 1:35 - 2:05: The Innovation (IAMF Export)
**Visual:** The "Export" Menu opens. 
**Action:** Mouse hovers over "WAV". Then moves to **"IAMF (Spatial)"**.
**Text Overlay:** **IAMF** (Immersive Audio Model and Formats)

**Voiceover:** "But why build in 3D if you export to 2D? Resonance is one of the first web tools to support **IAMF**—the new open standard from Google and Samsung."

**Visual:** Diagram showing Resonance -> IAMF File -> YouTube / Samsung Soundbar / VR Headset.
**Voiceover:** "We don't just render pixels. We render an object-based audio container that adapts to your device—whether it's a soundbar or a VR headset. Build once, resonate everywhere."

## 🌍 2:05 - 2:30: The Future (Outro)
**Visual:** The grid slowly zooms out to show a galaxy of projects.
**Voiceover:** "The flat era is over. It's time to unmute the spatial web."

**Visual:** Fade to Black. 
**Text:** "Try the Alpha @ [Link]"

## 📋 Production Notes for the "Apple Vibe"
1.  **Typography:** Use a clean, bold sans-serif font (Inter or Helvetica) for all overlays.
2.  **Timing:** Don't rush. Leave "air" between the sentences. Let the visual punch land before you explain it.
3.  **Contrast:** Ensure the "Silence" at the beginning is dead silent, so the "Sound" at the reveal hits hard.
