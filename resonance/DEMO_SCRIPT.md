# Resonance - Demo Video Script / Storyboard
**Target Duration:** 2:30 - 3:00 minutes
**Theme:** "The Future of Spatial Audio Authoring"

## Core Narrative
Audio engineering is stuck in 2D (stereo tracks), but the world is 3D. Creating spatial audio is hard/technical. **Resonance** makes it intuitive, semantic, and AI-assisted.

---

## 0:00 - 0:30: The Hook & Introduction
**Visual:**
- Start with a black screen.
- Fade in the **Resonance** logo/UI with the "Galaxy" background.
- Show the empty 3D grid.

**Script/Voiceover:**
"We are moving into an era of spatial computing—VR, AR, and immersive web. But audio tools are still stuck in stereo tracks."
"Meet **Resonance**: A spatial audio studio powered by Gemini 3. It allows you to design soundscapes not by moving sliders, but by describing scenes."

## 0:30 - 1:00: Feature 1 - The AI Director (Gemini 3)
**Visual:**
- Mouse clicks "AI Director".
- **Action:** User types: *"A busy cyberpunk market in Tokyo, raining neon, flying cars overhead."*
- **Reaction:**
    1. Show the "Thinking Panel" streaming the logic (Gemini 3 decomposing the prompt).
    2. *BAM* — Sources appear on the grid (Rain, Crowd, Hovercars, Neon hum).
    3. User hits "Play". We hear the immersive mix.

**Key Point:** "Don't search for files. Describe the vibe. Gemini understands semantics ('cyberpunk') and translates them into spatial coordinates and assets."

## 1:00 - 1:45: Feature 2 - Auto-Foley (Multimodal)
**Visual:**
- **Action:** User drags and drops a video file (e.g., a clip of a dog barking or a door slamming).
- **Reaction:**
    1. The "Thinking Panel" analyzes the video frames.
    2. Resonance automatically places a "Dog Bark" sound source at the exact position of the dog in the frame.
    3. User moves the source to adjust it.

**Key Point:** "With Gemini Multimodal, we can watch video and sound-design it instantly. Auto-Foley turns pixels into spatial audio objects."

## 1:45 - 2:15: Feature 3 - The Spatial Editor (IAMF)
**Visual:**
- Show the user manually dragging a source (e.g., a "Helicopter") around the listener head in the UI.
- Show the "Trajectory" lines.
- Zoom in on the "Export" button.
- **Action:** Click "Export Audio".
- Show the `.iamf` file downloading.

**Key Point:** "This isn't just a toy. It exports to **IAMF (Immersive Audio Model and Formats)**—the new open standard adopted by YouTube and Samsung. You build once, and it plays back correctly on headphones, soundbars, or home theaters."

## 2:15 - 3:00: Tech Stack & Closing
**Visual:**
- Rapid montage of the code/tech stack: Next.js, Web Audio API, Python (Export), and Gemini 3.5.
- Final shot: The completed soundscape playing with all visualizers active.
- Fade to GitHub link.

**Script/Voiceover:**
"Resonance bridges the gap between text, video, and immersive audio. Built for the Gemini 3 Hackathon. Experience the sound of the future."
