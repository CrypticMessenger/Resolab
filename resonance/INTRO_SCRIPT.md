| Time | Visual Scene | Voiceover / Text |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00** | **Montage:** Majestic AI videos (Sora/Veo style). A stormy ocean, a busy cyberpunk street, a quiet forest. <br>**CRITICAL:** They are completely **SILENT**. | **"The world of generative video is breathtaking..."**<br>*(Pause)*<br>**"...but it’s been living in silence."** |
| **0:05** | **SLAM CUT:** The Resonance Logo pulses on screen. <br> *Sound Effect: Massive, spatial sub-bass thud that travels L->R.* | **"This is Resonance."**<br>**"Your new spatial audio director. Built on Gemini 3."** |
| **0:10** | **Split Screen:** <br>Left: Veo 2 Video (Flat). <br>Right: Resonance UI (Depth Map). <br> *Action: A video file is dragged into the UI.* | **"Gemini 3 understands the physics of your scene. It doesn't just hear—it sees."** |
| **0:18** | **Auto-Foley Visuals:** <br>Video of glass breaking. <br>**UI Overlay:** Floating, tracking labels appear: <br>`[Detected: Impact]` <br>`[Material: Tempered Glass]` <br>`[Depth: 4.2m]` | **"Analyze materials. Identify events. Resonance projects 2D pixels into a 3D audio environment."** |
| **0:25** | **Spatial Cam:** The camera rotates around a 3D sound source. <br> *Sound Effect: The audio pans binaurally to match the rotation.* | **"Reflect it. Bend it. Give your imagination depth."** |
| **0:32** | **Director Mode:** <br>Input Box: *"Add a swarm of bees circling my head."* <br> *Action: 3D Yellow trails instantly spiral around the listener.* | **"Want to modify the narrative? Just ask."** |
| **0:40** | **Reasoning Visualization:** <br> A sleek node graph connects: <br>`Gemini 3 Flash` → `Trajectory Calc` → `Audio Graph`. | **"Gemini 3 reasons through context. It calculates trajectories, air pressure, and distance—automatically."** |
| **0:48** | **The Flex:** <br>Cursor hits **"Export IAMF"**. <br>Animation: Audio waves packaging into a 3D cube icon. | **"Design once. Hear it everywhere. Native support for IAMF—the new standard for immersive sound."** |
| **0:55** | **Final Montage:** <br>Rapid cuts of the "Veo 3" results with full audio. <br>Text Overlay: **Veo 2 Cost + Resonance = Veo 3 Quality** | **"Resonance. The Audio Layer for the Generative Web."** |
| **1:00** | **End Card:** <br>Logo center. <br>Subtitle: `Powered by Gemini 3`. | *(Fade to Black)* |
