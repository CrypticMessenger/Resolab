# Resolab - The Technical Demo (Hackathon Submission)
**Duration:** 3 Minutes
**Goal:** deeply demonstrate the **Technical Execution**, **Gemini 3 Reasoning**, and **Wow Factor**.

---

## � Phase 1: The "Veo 3" Upgrade (The Hook)
**[0:00 - 0:30]**

*   **Visual Setup:** Split Screen.
    *   **Left:** "Veo 2 Raw Output" (Silent video of a stormy forest).
    *   **Right:** "Resolab Upgrade" (Same video, but with a 3D mesh overlay).
*   **Action:**
    *   Play the Left video (Silence).
    *   Play the Right video (Roaring 3D audio: wind howling, trees creaking).
*   **Voiceover:**
    > "We are entering the golden age of generative video. Models like Veo 2 create visual masterpieces... but they are silent. They are ghost worlds."
    > *(Beat)*
    > "Meet **Resolab**. The first spatial audio DAW powered by **Gemini 3**. We took that silent video and gave it a voice, effectively upgrading it to **Veo 3** quality using pure AI reasoning."

## 🧠 Phase 2: Auto-Foley & Multimodal Reasoning
**[0:30 - 1:15]**

*   **Visual:** Drag & Drop a raw video file (e.g., "Walking on Gravel") into Resolab.
*   **The "Wow" Overlay:**
    *   As the AI processes, display a **"Gemini 3 Analysis Stream"** overlay in the corner.
    *   *Scrolling Text:* `Detected: Footsteps`, `Material: Wet Gravel (Confidence 98%)`, `Depth: Moving Z+ to Z-`.
*   **Voiceover:**
    > "Watch the Auto-Foley Agent. I simply upload a video."
    > "Gemini 3 Multimodal watches the scene. It identifies materials—distinguishing between concrete and gravel—and projects 2D pixels into a 3D audio environment."
*   **Visual:**
    *   A "Sound Emitter" dot appears at the actor's feet in the 3D grid.
    *   As the actor walks away in the video, the dot moves in the 3D grid.
*   **Voiceover:**
    > "It calculates depth automatically. As the actor walks away, the sound attenuates. I didn't touch a single fader. This is Gemini's reasoning in action."

## 🎨 Phase 3: Director Mode (Regeneration & Context)
**[1:15 - 1:45]**

*   **Visual:** The current scene is "Forest".
*   **Voiceover:**
    > "But Gemini 3 isn't just a generator; it's a Director. It understands physics, not just keywords."
*   **Action:**
    *   User types: *"Actually, make it a hostile alien planet."*
*   **The "Regenerate" Flex:**
    *   **Visual:** A "Re-imagining Scene..." loader appears. The "Bird" nodes **wipes away** completely.
    *   **New Nodes:** "Sci-Fi Drone" and "Alien Howl" nodes fade in.
*   **Voiceover:**
    > "Conventional tools make you delete tracks manually. But Resolab is generative."
    > "When I change the context, the AI Director wipes the slate and reconstructs the physics from scratch. It swaps earthly birds for alien drones and adjusts the atmospheric pressure."

## 🔁 Phase 4: Trajectories & Natural Language Control
**[1:45 - 2:20]**

*   **Visual:** A specific sound source (e.g., a "Hover Car").
*   **Action:**
    *   User types: *"Make the hover car circle around my head."*
*   **Visual:**
    *   The 3D trajectory line instantly snaps from "Linear" to "Orbit" (Circular path).
*   **Voiceover:**
    > "I don't need complex engineering tools. I just need English."
    > "Resolab understands that 'circle' means an orbital trajectory. It modifies the automation curve instantly."
*   **Audio Demo:**
    *   Play the sound. The car pans perfectly around the listener (Binaural 3D).

## 🚀 Phase 5: The Innovation (IAMF Export)
**[2:20 - 3:00]**

*   **Visual:** Click the **Export** menu. Hover over **"IAMF (Spatial)"**.
*   **Voiceover:**
    > "But why build in 3D if you export to 2D?"
    > "Resolab is one of the first web tools to support **IAMF**—the new open standard from Google and Samsung."
*   **Action:**
    *   Click Export. Show a "Muxing IAMF Container..." spinner.
    *   File downloads (`scene.iamf`).
*   **Visual:** Diagram: Resolab -> VR Headset / Soundbar / YouTube.
*   **Voiceover:**
    > "We don't just render pixels. We render an object-based audio container that adapts to your device—whether it's a soundbar or the Apple Vision Pro. Build once, resonate everywhere."
    > *(Fade to Logo)*
    > "**Resolab**. The Audio Layer for the Generative Web."
