## 🎥 Scene 1: The "Boring" 2D Waveform
**Context:** Connects to the intro line "Audio is stuck in 2D."
**Prompt:**
> A minimalist 2D audio waveform line, bright green on a solid black background. The line is scrolling horizontally in a boring, repetitive loop. Retro CRT monitor aesthetic with slight scanlines. 8-bit style. Low energy.

## 💥 Scene 2: The "Shatter" (Transition)
**Context:** The reveal of Resolab.
**Prompt:**
> A single 2D green glowing line on a black background suddenly exploding outwards into a complex 3D holographic grid. The line shatters into thousands of glowing data points that form a 3D cubic lattice structure. Cinematic lighting, volumetric fog, blue and purple neon highlights. High velocity, explosive motion. "Tron Legacy" art style.

## 🌧️ Scene 3: The "Input" (Tokyo Rain)
**Context:** The raw video file for the Auto-Foley demo. Needs clear visual cues for audio.
**Prompt:**
> A cinematic shot of a cyberpunk street in Tokyo at night, heavy rain pouring down. Neon signs reflecting on the wet pavement. A futuristic hover-car zooms past the camera from left to right. A pedestrian walks into a puddle, splashing water. High fidelity, photorealistic, 8k resolution, blade runner aesthetic.

## 🌌 Scene 4: The "Spatial Web" (Outro)
**Context:** The vision of the future.
**Prompt:**
> A vast network of glowing interconnected nodes floating in deep space. Each node represents a different user project. The camera slowly zooms out to reveal a galaxy-like structure made of light. Purple and Gold color palette. Ethereal, majestic, calm motion. "Interstellar" movie visual style.

## 💡 Best Practices for Veo3
*   **Iterate:** If the "shatter" isn't explosive enough, add keywords like `violent explosion`, `particle physics`, `slow motion`.
*   **Consistency:** Keep the background darkness consistent (Deep Black `#000000`) so scenes blend well with the UI screen recordings.
