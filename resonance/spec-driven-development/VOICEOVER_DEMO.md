# Voice-Over Script: Technical Demo (3 Minutes)
**Tone:** Professional, Confident, Explanatory (think "Google I/O Developer Keynote")

### Phase 1: The "Veo 3" Upgrade
"We are entering the golden age of generative video. Models like Veo 2 create visual masterpieces... but they are silent. They are ghost worlds."

"Meet Resolab. The first spatial audio DAW powered by Gemini 3. We took that silent video and gave it a voice, effectively upgrading it to Veo 3 quality using pure AI reasoning."

---

### Phase 2: Auto-Foley & Reasoning
"Watch the Auto-Foley Agent. I simply upload a video."

"Gemini 3 Multimodal watches the scene. It identifies materials—distinguishing between concrete and gravel—and projects 2D pixels into a 3D audio environment."

"It calculates depth automatically. As the actor walks away, the sound attenuates. I didn't touch a single fader. This is Gemini's reasoning in action."

---

### Phase 3: The Director (Regeneration)
"But Gemini 3 isn't just a generator; it's a Director. It understands physics, not just keywords."

"Conventional tools make you delete tracks manually. But Resolab is generative."

"When I change the context, the AI Director wipes the slate and reconstructs the physics from scratch. It swaps earthly birds for alien drones and adjusts the atmospheric pressure."

---

### Phase 4: Natural Language Control
"I don't need complex engineering tools. I just need English."

"Resolab understands that 'circle' means an orbital trajectory. It modifies the automation curve instantly."

---

### Phase 5: IAMF Export & Conclusion
"But why build in 3D if you export to 2D?"

"Resolab is one of the first web tools to support IAMF—the new open standard from Google and Samsung."

"We don't just render pixels. We render an object-based audio container that adapts to your device—whether it's a soundbar or the Apple Vision Pro. Build once, resonate everywhere."

"Resolab. The Audio Layer for the Generative Web."
